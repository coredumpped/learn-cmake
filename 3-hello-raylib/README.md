```sh
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . --parallel
```

If clangd is not reading your build folder, 
it's likely due to one of the following reasons:
1. Missing compile_commands.json:
Check for the file:
Clangd relies on a compile_commands.json file to understand how your project is built. This file is typically generated by your build system (e.g., CMake, Make, etc.). Ensure that the file exists in your build directory or a parent directory.
Generate the file:
If the file is missing, you'll need to generate it. For CMake, add the following flag to your CMake command: -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON. For other build systems, refer to their respective documentation.

2. Incorrect location:
Clangd search path:
Clangd automatically searches for compile_commands.json in the parent directories of the file you're editing, as well as in subdirectories named build/. Ensure that your build folder is within this search path.
Manual configuration:
If you need to specify the location explicitly, you can:
Set the compile_commands_dir option in your clangd configuration file (.clangd).
Use the --compile-commands-dir command-line flag when launching clangd.
3. Outdated compile_commands.json:
Rebuild your project: If you've made changes to your project's build configuration, you'll need to rebuild it to generate an updated compile_commands.json file.
Restart clangd: After updating the file, restart clangd to ensure it picks up the changes.
4. Permissions issue:
Check permissions: Make sure that clangd has the necessary permissions to read the compile_commands.json file and the files within your build directory.
Troubleshooting:
Check clangd logs:
Run clangd with the --log=verbose flag to get more insights into what it's doing and why it might not be reading the build folder.
Use the --check flag:
You can use the --check flag to parse a single file in isolation, which can help you pinpoint the problem.

```sh
# Generate compile_commands.json with CMake
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON .. 

# Run clangd with verbose logging
clangd --log=verbose 
```
